In this code, we first import the Image module from the PIL library. We then define the file path to the image using the raw string (r) notation to avoid any issues with backslashes in the file path.

Next, we use the Image.open() method to open the image file specified by the file path. This method returns an Image object, which we store in the img variable.

Finally, we use the show() method of the Image object to display the image. Note that this will open the image in the default image viewer on your system. If you want to manipulate or process the image further, you can use the various methods available in the PIL library.
